Instead of using a histogram that shows the data in categories, this chart uses a continuous curve to show the distribution. In this method, instead of categorizing the data like a histogram, a kernel function is used. It is used to estimate the distribution curve. The shape of this curve depends on the kernel function parameters.\n",
